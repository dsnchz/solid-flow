### üìã **Migration Notes**

This is the first release, so no migration is needed. However, developers familiar with React Flow or Svelte Flow should note:

- Uses **stores instead of signals** for state management
- Connection handling uses `onConnect` with store updates rather than state setters
- TypeScript patterns follow SolidJS conventions
- Event handlers receive SolidJS-specific event objects
